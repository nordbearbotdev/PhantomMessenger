# PhantomMessenger
Phantom It is one of the open source decentralized network (mesh) technologies designed to provide a reliable network and reliable peer-to-peer communication without centralized servers and with minimal dependence on external infrastructure. Connections are made via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or via the Internet via Tor, and all messages are encrypted with terminal encryption. The relevant content is stored in encrypted form on the participants ' devices. Long-term plans for the project "including blogs, crisis mapping and collaborative document editing".
