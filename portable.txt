This file (portable.txt) is used to indicate that
Phantom is running in portable mode. If this file
is found in this folder, all config and data will
be stored in the program folder itself, rather
than in the users home directory.

If you delete this file, then PhantomMessenger will create
a folder ~/.phantommessenger (or %AppData%\torchat on w32)
on the computer's harddisk and store it's
configuration and data there, so if you plan to
run the program from a removable media, leave this
file where it is.

Distributors and packagers remove this file if
a fixed installation of PhantomMessenger is desired.

The contents of this file are irrelevant. It could
also be completely empty. It is only checked if
there is a file "portable.txt" or not.
